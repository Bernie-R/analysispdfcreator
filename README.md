# analysispdfcreator
A automatic PDF creator for LC/MS-analysis.  It was requested by my colleague and basically reads and excel sheet, plots the data and structures it in a pdf report automatically

## GUI
I've created a small GUI for my colleague to make it easier for my non-programming colleague to use. The GUI was buildt with PYQT5

## Example pdf
This is the first page of the PDF - report, I had to censor some of the contact information and legend.
